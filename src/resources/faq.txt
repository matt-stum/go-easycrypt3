# EasyCrypt3


## Questions and Answers

Q: What is it?

A: A simple tool for encrypting and decrypting files using a password.

---

Q: How do I install it?

A: Just copy the EasyCrypt3.exe file to any location you like. The desktop is a
good place to keep it handy.  You may also want to drop a copy onto your
thumbdrives and/or external hard drives for when you're away from your local
computer.

Q: How do I use it?

A: The simplest method is to drag one or more files or folders onto the
EasyCrypt3 icon in Windows. You will be prompted for a password which will be
used to encrypt or decrypt each of the files. When encrypting a file, a new file
with the same name will be created with the addition of a .crypt extension and
the original file will be deleted. The reverse happens when decrypting.

Q: Can I change some of the things about how it works?

A: You can change many of the behavioral defaults by running EasyCrypt3.exe
in a command-line window and specifying qualifiers on the command line. A full
list of qualifiers and default values can be seen by running 
`EasyCrypt3.exe --help` at a command-line prompt.

Q: What were the design criteria? Why is there no graphical user interface?

A: The original design criteria for this tool were as follows:
  * Must be usable by batch automation and integration scripts, thus
    * All configuration input must be available via command-line
    * All output must be available via STDOUT
  * Must have a sensible set of defaults to use in Windows drag-n-drop mode
  * Must allow for encrypted files to be sent via email, thus
    * There must not be any reliance on hardware or Windows credentials
  * Use industry-standard crypto algorithms for cross-platform support
  * Must not require installation

Q: What type of security is used?

A: The file contents are encrypted using AES256 and key generation uses PBKDF2-SHA256
with over 100,000 iterations. Password validation uses PBKDF2-SHA512 with over 100,000
iterations. By default, plaintext files are completely overwritten before deletion to
prevent "undelete" programs or hex editors from recovering the sensitive data.

Q: What happens if I forget the password to decrypt a file?

A: You're pretty much out of luck. There are no backdoors or workarounds or
key recovery. Making any of those features possible would GREATLY reduce the
security of the encryption.

Q: Can I rename the encrypted files?

A: Yes. The original filename is stored in the encrypted file. Additionally,
EasyCrypt3 does not rely on the file extension to determine whether a file is
encrypted or not. A common scenario would be to rename the encrypted file with a
.txt extension to get through email attachment filters.  You can also rename the
encrypted files to make them less obvious on your computer. For example, you can
encrypt MyTaxes.pdf and then rename the resulting MyTaxes.pdf.crypt to
BoringMeeting.ppt. When you decrypt BoringMeeting.ppt it will automatically
change back to MyTaxes.pdf by default.
